# Java Interview Prep
This repository is a collection of Java projects for brushing up on Data Structures and Algorithms.

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello ðŸ‘‹
If you found this work to be helpful and would like support me, please consider getting me a â˜• ko-fi :)

## We Used Generics
The custom Data Structure and Algorithm Java classes are written with Generics. 
A Java class with Generics has a parameterized type which allows that Java class to use a different data type. 

Example: The Java List class uses Generics to allow us to define a list of different Data Types. 
```Java:
List<String> listOfStrings = new ArrayList<>();
List<Integer> listOfIntegers = new ArrayList<>();
```
